            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I always knew that I wanted to do programming, even if I didn't know how and what was it. I just knew that I would like to make some code with my computer, now I know that it's much more complicated than that, but I love it anyway.<br>My programming journey started with HTML and CSS which I got the hang of them very quickly, then I learned JS, Java, Python, Assembly...</p>

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Recently I became interested in how life works and what to do when you fall, I think all of us should learn themselves and know how to go through the difficulties of life. If you do so, you will be rewarded by life and your friends that will benefit your spirit and compassion. You will become a better person.</p>

            <h2>Cooking</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Since I was little I wanted to impress my parents with my food. I find cooking very simple, at least sometime, you just need to follow a recipe and it tells you every thing you need to know to make that dish, the difficult part is in memorizing those recipes and know how much you need to put depending on how many people are eating.</p>

                <h2>FrontEnd</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Like I said before I started programming this year and at school they taught us HTML, CSS and other things which without expectation I learned them without any problem especially with HTML and CSS. Now with the front end part I just love making my projects like in this case I'm making my own portfolio</p>

                <h2>BackEnd</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>This year I also started learning Java, Python, JavaScript and Assembly8086 which are back end programming languages and I made good progress in this final period I hope in the future I will improve even more in these languages and be able to make some fun software by myself.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>After all of the researches I have made I would say that I have pretty good knowledge about how do computers work both hardware and software parts. The work behind a computer is insane once you discover how it works and also very interesting.</p>
